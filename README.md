## Abstract

Soft-biometrics play an important role in face recognition and related fields since these might lead to biased performances, threatens the user, or are valuable for commercial aspects. Current face database are specifically constructed for the development of face recognition applications. Consequently, these databases contain large amount of diverse face but lack in the number of attribute annotations and the overall annotation correctness. In this work, we propose MAAD-Face, a new face database that is characterized by the large number of its high-quality attribute annotations. MAAD-Face consists of 3.3M faces of over 9k individuals. Using a novel annotation transfer-pipeline that allows an accurate label-transfer from multiple source-datasets to a target-dataset, MAAD-Face consists of 123.9M attribute annotations of 47 different binary attributes. Consequently, it provides 15 and 137 times more attribute labels than CelebA and LFW. Our investigation on the annotation quality by three human evaluators demonstrated the superiority of the MAAD-Face annotations over the other databases. Finally, we make use of the large amount of high-quality annotations from MAAD-Face to study the usefulness of soft-biometrics for recognition, providing insights about which attributes support genuine and imposter decision.
